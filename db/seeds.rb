    summary: "This was my first coding project, my goal was to create an interactive experience that took in user input and then reacted accordingly. For my project I chose to create a Trivia game. I pulled questions and categories from a Trivia API. When a user interacts with the game, they first select a category, then a question appears and they select an answer, the game then reacts depending on whether they are correct or not.",
